# BeingExtra

A simple calendar-based app that allows any person working as an extra in the film industry to check their bookings and document their earnings.

Easily add a new booking for show or movie and add call time, union status, optional extra rentals and location. Once the wrap time has been inputted, the app will calculate the next paycheque earning deducting any commission made by the agent.

Currently working copy.

**** Future version will include a navigation bar for other elements****
